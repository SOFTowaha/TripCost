# TripCost Roadmap

This roadmap is derived from the "Future Plans" section in `README.md` and organized into milestones and iterations. Use the provided script to create a GitHub Project (Kanban) with iterations and seed issues automatically.

## Timeline (target)

  - Weather forecasts for destinations

- 2025-12 (Sprint 2)
  - Packing lists (food, clothing, gear)
  - Campground finder integration
  - Export trip data to PDF/CSV

- 2026-01 (Sprint 3)
  - Per-day expense breakdown

These are targets and may shift as we learn.
